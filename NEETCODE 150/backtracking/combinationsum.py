# https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/description/
# Given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer target, return a list of all unique combinations of candidates where the chosen numbers sum to target. You may return the combinations in any order.
# The same number may be chosen from candidates an unlimited number of times. Two combinations are unique if the 
# frequency
#  of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.
# The test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations that sum up to target is less than 150 combinations for the given input.

# Example 1:

# Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
# Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]
# Explanation:
# 2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times.
# 7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.
# These are the only two combinations.

class Solution:
    # Time Complexity:
    #   Best case: O(2^n) - backtracking exploration of all combinations
    #   Average case: O(2^n)
    #   Worst case: O(2^n)
    # Space Complexity: O(target/min_candidate)
