# Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.
# Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/
# A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.
# For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
# A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.
# Example 1:
# Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
# Output: 3  
# Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.

class Solution:
    # Time Complexity:
    #   Best case: O(n²) - nested iteration
    #   Average case: O(n²)
    #   Worst case: O(n²)
    # Space Complexity: O(1)
