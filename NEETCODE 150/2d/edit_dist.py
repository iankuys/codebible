# Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.

# You have the following three operations permitted on a word:
# Insert a character
# Delete a character
# Replace a character

# Example 1:

# Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: 
# horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
# rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
# rose -> ros (remove 'e')

class Solution:
    # Time Complexity:
    #   Best case: O(n²) - nested iteration
    #   Average case: O(n²)
    #   Worst case: O(n²)
    # Space Complexity: O(1)

        for j in range(len(word2) + 1):
            dp[len(word1)][j] = len(word2) - j
        for i in range(len(word1) + 1):

            for j in range(len(word2) - 1, -1, -1):

                    dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j+1]
                else:
