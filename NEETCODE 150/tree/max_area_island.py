# You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.
# Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/max-area-of-island/

# The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

# Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.

class Solution:
    # Time Complexity:
    #   Best case: O(V + E) - graph traversal
    #   Average case: O(V + E)
    #   Worst case: O(V + E)
    # Space Complexity: O(m Ã— n)
