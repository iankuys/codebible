# Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.
# Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/

# The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

# The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

# Time Complexity:
#   Best case: O(n) - tree traversal where h is height
#   Average case: O(n)
#   Worst case: O(n)
# Space Complexity: O(h)
