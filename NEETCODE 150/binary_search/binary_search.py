# 704. Binary Search
# Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

# You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        
        high = len(nums) - 1
        low = 0
        mid = 0
        while (low <= high):
            mid = (low + high) // 2

            if nums[mid] == target:
                return mid
            elif nums[mid] < target:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid - 1
