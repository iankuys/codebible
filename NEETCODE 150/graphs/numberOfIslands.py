#Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

# An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.
# conditions for an island to exist, top down left right are land
# once we have neighbors that are not 1 then we stop
# boundary conditions are the length of the grid and each element

class Solution:
    # Time Complexity:
    #   Best case: O(n²) - nested iteration
    #   Average case: O(n²)
    #   Worst case: O(n²)
    # Space Complexity: O(1)
