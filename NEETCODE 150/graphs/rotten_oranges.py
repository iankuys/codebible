# 994. Rotting Oranges
# You are given an m x n grid where each cell can have one of three values:

# 0 representing an empty cell,
# 1 representing a fresh orange, or
# 2 representing a rotten orange.
# Every minute, any fresh orange that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

# Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. If this is impossible, return -1.

class Solution:
    # Time Complexity:
    #   Best case: O(n²) - nested iteration
    #   Average case: O(n²)
    #   Worst case: O(n²)
    # Space Complexity: O(1)
