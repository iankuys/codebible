# You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.

# Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.

# You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.
# https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/description/
# Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
# Output: 3
# Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1

class Solution:
    # Time Complexity:
    #   Best case: O(n²) - nested iteration
    #   Average case: O(n²)
    #   Worst case: O(n²)
    # Space Complexity: O(1)
