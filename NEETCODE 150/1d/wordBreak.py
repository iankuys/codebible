# Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, return true if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

# Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet","code"]
# Output: true
# Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen"]
# Output: true
# Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
# Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.
