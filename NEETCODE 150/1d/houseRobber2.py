# You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are arranged in a circle. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.
# Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.
# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [2,3,2]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses.

class Solution:
    # Time Complexity:
    #   Best case: O(n) - linear operation
    #   Average case: O(n)
    #   Worst case: O(n)
    # Space Complexity: O(1)
