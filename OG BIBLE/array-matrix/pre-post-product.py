# Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
# The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
# You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.
# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
# Output: [24,12,8,6]

# What helped me was imagining a generic example without numbers.
# nums = [a, b, c, d]
# Each item in the list below is the pre and post values ​​multiplied by the list sol in each round.
# pre = [1, 1a, 1ab, 1abc]
# pos = [1bcd, 1cd, 1d, 1]
# Multiplying pre and post item by item:
# pre*pro = [1bcd, 1acd, 1abd, 1abc] -> Solution

class Solution:
    # Time Complexity:
    #   Best case: O(n) - linear scan
    #   Average case: O(n)
    #   Worst case: O(n)
    # Space Complexity: O(1)
