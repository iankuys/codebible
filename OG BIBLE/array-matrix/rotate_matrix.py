# 48. Rotate Image
# You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).
# You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

    #   Best case: O(n²) - nested iteration

    # Space Complexity: O(1)
