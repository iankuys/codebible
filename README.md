### File Naming Convention

Files are generally named after the problem they solve, often including the LeetCode problem number or a descriptive name that reflects the algorithm used.

### How to Navigate

1. If you're preparing for a specific company, check the `TAGGED/` directory first
2. For systematic algorithm practice, use the `NEETCODE 150/` directory
3. For additional problems and implementations, explore the `OG BIBLE/` directory
4. For recent online assessment questions, refer to the `OAs/` directory
